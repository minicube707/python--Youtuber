# 📘 Python Learning Projects – Machine Learnia

A curated collection of **Python projects and experiments** inspired by the excellent tutorials from the **Machine Learnia** YouTube channel.  
This repository documents my learning journey through machine learning, neural networks, and image processing using Python.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Learn and practice **Python for Machine Learning**
- Understand core concepts through **hands-on projects**
- Experiment beyond the tutorials with personal modifications
- Improve code quality via **refactoring and commenting**
- Build a structured learning archive for future reference

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a tutorial or learning module and contains:

- Python source code from the tutorial
- Personal experiments, tweaks, or extensions
- Refactoring, comments, and clarifications when relevant

> ⚠️ Folder names are intentionally kept close to the original tutorials to preserve the learning path.
