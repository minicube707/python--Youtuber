# 🧠 Deep Learning – Machine Learnia Playlist

This repository contains Python scripts inspired by the **Deep Learning** playlist from the **Machine Learnia** YouTube channel.  
It documents my learning journey through artificial neurons, neural networks, and deep learning concepts, with both tutorial-based code and personal experiments.

## 📂 Files Description

###  Neuron_Artificielle_1.py
Code based on the following video:  
https://youtu.be/5TpBe7KTAHE  

This script implements a **single artificial neuron (logistic regression)** from scratch and introduces the fundamental concepts of deep learning.

---

###  Neuron_Artificielle_1_Bonus.py
Same base code as `Neuron_Artificielle_1.py`, with an additional **3D visualization** of the loss function to better understand optimization and gradient descent.

---

###  Neuron_Network_2_Couches.py
Code inspired by a Machine Learnia tutorial introducing a **two-layer neural network**.  
The model is trained on:
- a **circular dataset**
- the **Cats vs Dogs** classification problem

---

###  Neuron_Artificielle_Dog_VS_CAT_Exercice.py
My personal implementation to solve the **Cats vs Dogs** classification task, written as an exercise without directly using the correction.

---

###  Neuron_Artificielle_Dog_VS_CAT_Corrigé.py
Correction code based on the following video:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGkDR4Zl0A  

---

###  Deep_Neuron_Network.py
Code based on this video:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NRLysodIwY  

This script implements a **deep neural network** from scratch, extending previous concepts to multiple hidden layers.

---

###  Deep_Neuron_Network_2.py
An experimental script where I attempt to train a deep neural network on the **digits dataset from `sklearn`**.  
The goal is to understand how the model learns **step by step**.  
⚠️ This file is exploratory and may contain unfinished or suboptimal ideas.

---

###  Demonstration_de_normalisation.py
A personal script created to **demonstrate the importance of data normalization** and explain how normalization impacts **gradient descent and learning speed**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand deep learning concepts **from scratch**
- Implement neural networks without high-level frameworks
- Visualize learning dynamics and gradients
- Experiment, modify, and extend tutorial code
- Build a solid conceptual foundation in deep learning
