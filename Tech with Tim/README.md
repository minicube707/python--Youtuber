# 📘 Python Learning Projects – Tech with Tim

A curated collection of Python projects and experiments based on high-quality tutorials from the **Tech with Tim** YouTube channel.  
Each folder represents a specific concept, project, or programming topic explored while learning Python from **intermediate to advanced levels**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Strengthen Python fundamentals and intermediate concepts  
- Improve **problem-solving** and algorithmic thinking  
- Learn **game development** with Pygame  
- Explore **machine learning** and **neural networks**  
- Build hands-on projects following real-world tutorials  
- Maintain a clean and well-structured learning repository  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder contains:
- Python source code from the tutorial
- Personal experiments or improvements
- Refactoring and comments when relevant

> ⚠️ Folder names are kept as-is to reflect the original learning structure.
