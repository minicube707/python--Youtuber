# 🌌 Solar System – Versions & Experiments

This folder contains several **implementations and experimental versions** of a Solar System simulation project.  
Each file represents an **evolution or variation** of the original simulation, with added features, optimizations, or simplifications.

The file **`Simulation Solar System 1.py`** is the **reference implementation**.  
All other versions are based on it.

---

## 🧩 Reference Version

### **Simulation Solar System 1.py**
- Initial and basic implementation of a Solar System simulation  
- Serves as the foundation for all subsequent versions  

---

## 🚀 Improved Versions

### **Simulation Solar System 2.py**
- Based on version 1  
- Adds:
  - A distance scale to visualize distances between celestial bodies  
  - All moons of the Solar System  

---

### **Simulation Solar System 3.py**
- Based on version 2  
- Improves the **zoom system** for better navigation and visualization  

---

## 🪐 Simplified Versions

### **Simulation Solar System 4 planets #1.py**
- Simplified version of the reference implementation  
- Includes only the **four inner planets** (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars)  
- Displays only the **distance from the Sun**  

---

### **Simulation Solar System 4 planets #2.py**
- Another simplified version based on the reference implementation  
- Includes only the **four inner planets**, while keeping more features from version 1

## 📌 Notes
- File names reflect the **evolution and purpose** of each version  
- This project is mainly intended for **experimentation, learning, and visualization**  
- Future improvements may include performance optimizations or more accurate physics
